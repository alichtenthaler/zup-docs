ZUP is an open-source platform that allows gathering, organizing and sharing of information about urban services (manhole cleaning, rubbish collecting, gap closing, tree pruning and others) and diverse public or private inventories. As a system, the report management, inventories and work flow are present without having a predetermined purpose, allowing the organizations that adopt the platform to gain visibility in different areas of operation through the specific configuration its businesses require.  

In order to facilitate the access and availability, the project offers three mobile applications with two different purposes:
the first one, ZUP Cidadão, is available for iOS and Android platforms, and allows users to register, follow and share reports with other users. The second one, ZUP Técnico, was developed for Android and allows managing of reports and inventories via cellphone or tablet. This second application was created aiming to facilitate the work of supervisors and other field professionals, making it easier for them to interact with the system. Offline support for edition and creation of reports and inventories is also available.

There are also three other web applications with the following purposes:

 - Landing page: a page that allows cities adopting ZUP Cidadão to introduce the system to the final users and to direct them to the system that is more adequate for their platform.
 - ZUP Cidadão web: it has the same purpose of the mobile citizen applications and allows the users to interact with the report system and the inventory of the system.
 - ZUP Painel: administrative web interface with full access to all of the system functionalities. Besides administrative users, all who participate in any of the steps of the report and inventory management have access to the functions granted to them by the application.
